## Chapter 4
- Telemetry:
  - [ ] TODO: OpenTelemetry w/Honeycomb: [Honeycomb.io](https://ui.honeycomb.io)
  - [ ] TODO: Verify Sentry (will address with error handling - it's a mess right now)

## Chapter 5
- A bit different w/SurrealDB
  - No offline compile-time verification
  - No 'lazy' connection to SurrealDB (would require refactoring initialization code to endpoint handler - doable, but dumb)

- ok, so I'm going to have to refactor this stupid thing - it totally breaks the flow of the book if I don't
  - [x] instead of connection pool, pass configurations
  - [x] initialize database connection (post init.sh migration) at the handler
  - [x] major refactor of the tests to create configs/migrations within the tests

### Deployment Configuration
- zero2axum:
  - ~~Dockerfile deployment via `spec.yaml` to Digital Ocean Apps~~
    - turns out that managing `git-crypt` secrets with Dockerfile deployment and DO Apps Framework sucks (or at least I couldn't figure it out)
  - switched to Fly.io:
    - [x] Local deployment via `flyctl deploy` after using `fly launch` to generate the `fly.toml` config file worked painslessly (and without wrestling with git-crypt)
    - [x] [Fly.io CD Setup](https://fly.io/docs/app-guides/continuous-deployment-with-github-actions/)
- SurrealDB (5.4.4 Connecting To Digital Oceanâ€™s Postgres Instance): 
  - [x] ~~VPS w/Docker deployment to Digital Ocean Droplet~~
  - this got needlessly complicated and non-automated (domain names, etc.) - might as well just host my own
  - [x] Host SurrealDB on personal VPS (in my case, k3s cluster running on Hetzner)
  - [x] SSL does horrible, terrible things and doesn't work [Bug: 1929](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/issues/1929) ([Fix: PR#1960](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/pull/1960))
  - [x] Refactor 'production' environment to reflect `Wss` vs `Ws` connection and new database endpoint

## Chapter 6
- Type Safety: just a note, lack of `sqlx` kinda sucks ... 6.5 clearly shows the issue where a query is binding a field to a struct (instead of &str), and I know that will explode ... but it's silent without anything that guarantees type-safe queries.

- pretty straight forward - only some minor errata around the `fake` crate and using `Arbitrary` ... no longer using rng as a trait, now it uses a struct - there's a link to the issue in the source
